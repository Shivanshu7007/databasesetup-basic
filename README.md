Database Connection Setup Basics: Install, configure, and secure a connection between an application and a database for efficient data management.
# Summary of this project
The project involves establishing fundamental MongoDB connection setup basics, including installation, configuration, and security measures, to enable efficient data management in applications.

The project involves:
Initiating a Node.js project with npm init.
Creating folders (src and database) with a db.js file, and files (index.js and constants.js) in the src folder.
Installing necessary packages (mongoose, express, dotenv) using npm i.
Adding the nodemon package for development.
Updating package.json with a script (dev) for running the code with nodemon.
This setup is geared towards a Node.js application using MongoDB, with necessary dependencies and a development script for automatic code reloading.
